# Clarity

**Your mind, decoded.**

Clarity is a mental health self-tracking app that turns unstructured journal entries into structured insights. Write freely about your day — mood, energy, medications, activities — and AI automatically extracts patterns you can't see yourself.

## The Problem

Every mood tracker asks you to fill out forms, rate sliders, and categorize feelings. Life isn't that structured. Clarity takes a different approach: **write anything, in any format, and let AI do the structuring.**

## How It Works

1. **Write anything** — Type, speak, ramble. No forms, no categories.
2. **AI structures it** — Mood, energy, meds, activities extracted automatically.
3. **See your patterns** — Discover what actually drives your mental state.

*"I've been managing ADHD for years. Frustrated by the lack of tools that connect daily data to treatment outcomes, I started tracking myself manually. The patterns I discovered changed my treatment. Clarity is that system, built for everyone."*
